### How to ace interview as a New grad

I ended my journey of landing my first job recently. I cleared few interviews from different companies with only 50-60 job applications, and got some decent offers. I know I aced the interview, when I negotiating my pay the company approved for the new pay instantly and I didn't even mention compating offers. Here are some tips for the people who just got into the industry and looking for their first job just like me.

#### Increase the chance of getting a first round interview/OA

You will need a resume that is short (one page) but also very representative for yourself. 

**Put your most powerful experience on the top of the resume**

here is my example:
I don't have too much intern experience, I only have 2 months of SWE experience at Dell Technologies in the past 6 years(Bachelor + Master), but I do have a fancy GPA which is 4.0 out of 4.0, so I decided to build my resume in order of Educations > Skills > Work Experiences > Projects. I also added my TA experience for the Object-Orient Design class, which gives me extra 7 months of work experience since that OOD is a skill that is highly valued for the SWE position.

**Do not randomly add skills to your resume** 

Some people might think that more skills on the resume can make you over other candidates, but this is not true. You want to add the tech stacks that you are truly comfortable with, In my case, I said the following:
1. WebSocket, HTML, CSS, J2EE
2. Redis, MySQL
3. Spring, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Vue CLI
4. Tomcat, Maven, GIT, AWS

These skills are more than enough to prove my experience as SWE. These skills can apply to full-stack software engineering, and your recruiter/interviewer will immediately notice them.

**Mention what you've done instead of what your team've done**

Try to show off what you've done as an individual contributor, don't ever mention a bunch of Work descriptions/Project descriptions to explain how fancy the product is.

You can have something like these in your work experience:
1. Noticed a small bug in the existing code, and increased service uptime by fixing the bug.
2. Suggested a better solution, compared to the original one, it has .....

If you are having difficulties listing these experiences, don't afraid to exaggerate what you have done.
