### How to ace interview as a New grad

I ended my journey of landing my first job recently. I cleared few interviews from different companies with only 50-60 job applications, and got some decent offers. I know I aced the interview, when I negotiating my pay the company approved for the new pay instantly and I didn't even mention compating offers. Here are some tips for the people who just got into the industry and looking for their first job just like me.

#### Increase the chance of getting a first round interview/OA

You will need a resume that is short (one page) but also very representative for yourself. 

**Put your most powerful experience on the top of the resume**

here is my example:
I don't have too much intern experience, I only have 2 months of SWE experience at Dell Technologies in the past 6 years(Bachelor + Master), but I do have a fancy GPA which is 4.0 out of 4.0, so I decided to build my resume in order of Educations > Skills > Work Experiences > Projects. I also added my TA experience for the Object-Orient Design class, which gives me extra 7 months of work experience since that OOD is a skill that is highly valued for the SWE position.

**Do not randomly add skills to your resume** 

Some people might think that more skills on the resume can make you over other candidates, but this is not true. You want to add the tech stacks that you are truly comfortable with, In my case, I said the following:
1. WebSocket, HTML, CSS, J2EE
2. Redis, MySQL
3. Spring, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Vue CLI
4. Tomcat, Maven, GIT, AWS

These skills are more than enough to prove my experience as SWE. These skills can apply to full-stack software engineering, and your recruiter/interviewer will immediately notice them.

**Mention what you've done instead of what your team've done**

Try to show off what you've done as an individual contributor, don't ever mention a bunch of Work descriptions/Project descriptions to explain how fancy the product is.

You can have something like these in your work experience:
1. Noticed a small bug in the existing code, and increased service uptime by fixing the bug.
2. Suggested a better solution, compared to the original one, it has .....

If you are having difficulties listing these experiences, don't afraid to exaggerate what you have done.

#### Apply to companies that has different scale

Try not to only aim for the FAANG-like companies, also apply to those small/mid-tier companies even though you won't join them. Try to get into their interview process, and it would be great if you could make it to the onsite or even get the offers. This should tell you where your skill is, what you are missing, and how you going to better prepare for your dream companies. 

If your resume can't pass the resume screening phase for those small companies, you are highly likely to fail the resume screening for FAANG-like companies and you need to revise your resume.

If you AC'ed all test cases in an OA phase, but still get rejected and are not able to move into the next round, make sure your coding style is following good coding practices. If you finished earlier, try to optimize your solution like what you suppose to do in the white-board coding round.

#### Preparing for the leetcode style rounds

One of the most helpful tools is leetcode you possibly already heard about it. However, leetcode can be very inefficient if you don't know how to use it properly and dive into some random problems. 

Here are some tips if you are new to the leetcode.

1. Do the problems category by category to solidify your understanding of each algorithm.
2. Start with a few Easy-level problems. (around 3-5) and jump to the middle-level problems. When you cannot solve a middle-level problem in 30 mins, go to the solution, and spend another 30-60mins to understand it. When you working on hard-level problems, do not look at the solutions, take your time and finish it eventually.
3. Before working on a problem, read the problem description, and think about "Is this a good leetcode problem, how likely is I will face a similar problem to this one in the future? If I solve it, can I solve other problems by reusing the solution I found?" If you think it is a bad problem, skip it. If you think it is a good problem, solve it and record it, come back to it after a few weeks. 
4. After you are familiar with the most popular algorithms, try to do the blind75 question sets and do more hard-level problems. I prefer a ratio of 1(easy):7(mid):2(hard) when practicing my coding round.
5. Utilize the companies that give free OA. Companies like eBay, Quora, etc. will send you an OA as long as you applied to their posted job position. While grinding the leetcode, take some of these free OA and see where your coding skill is.

#### Some company have different interview style

Delta AirLine is one of the companies that doesn't have a coding interview. Instead, they give me a take-home assignment. In this case, you need to understand what this take-home assignment is looking for. Reach out to your HR/Manager, and clarify the requirement by repeating your thoughts and how you gonna implement the take-home assignment, you can do this simply by sending him/her an email.

The take-home assignment usually won't take you too much time as long as you are familiar with any full-stack tech stacks. You might be given 3 days ish to finish your take-home assignment, and in fact that you can finish it in one day. Take your time even though you finish earlier, record a demo video and send it to your HR/Manager, and ask for some feedback. Also, don't forget to write your design doc and readme file. You should have the instructions on how to reproduce your project, make sure you mention all the required steps and libraries.

#### Ace the Virtual-Onsite

I've seen a lot of people feeling great after they complete their onsite, they think they ace'd the interview and secured their offer. However, they failed. To be honest, until I got my offers, I always feel that I fucked up something during the onsite, and so likely to fail. For example, during my Indeed onsite I forgot to introduce myself in every single round, and I was only aware that after the interviews are all done.

Do not give an expectation on what you will do, what bar you need to meet, and how your interviewer will test you. People usually assume that each whiteboard coding onsite will have a base problem and 1 to 2 follow-up problems, the most challenging whiteboard coding I've seen has 7 follow-ups, the interviewers keep giving me new problems until the time ran out. So don't waste too much time explaining your thought and solution to the interviewers, especially the brute force solution, you might just wasting the time and that will make you miss some of the follow-ups.

However, you do want to keep communicating with your interviewers. Instead of walking them through your algorithm, tell them why you pick this algorithm over some other possible solutions, and what are the pros and cons. If you are writing down some code that handles the edge cases, tell your interviewers why you do need this and how it works.
